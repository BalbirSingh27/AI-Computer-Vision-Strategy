# 🧠 Enterprise Computer Vision Projects

This repository showcases a collection of applied computer vision projects developed using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **OpenCV**, focused on real-world tasks such as image classification, face detection, model interpretability, and transfer learning. All projects were executed in **Jupyter Notebooks hosted on AWS EC2 virtual machines** as part of the **AI and Data Analytics Strategy** course.

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1. 🔬 Binary Classification using Custom Deep Neural Network (Breast Cancer)
- Implemented a **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** using only **NumPy**
- Trained on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset** for binary classification
- Designed manual forward/backward propagation for full model control
- Used **logistic and ReLU activations** with custom loss and accuracy metrics
- Achieved high accuracy in classifying **malignant vs benign tumors**
- Visualized cost and accuracy convergence over iterations

### 2. 📷 Image Classification with CNN using Keras
- Built a custom **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture using `TensorFlow/Keras`
- Preprocessed image data using `img_to_array`, `load_img`, and pixel normalization
- Applied **data augmentation** for generalization
- Trained, validated, and visualized results using `matplotlib`

### 3. 😊 Face Detection and Recognition using OpenCV
- Used `OpenCV`’s Haar Cascade classifiers for **real-time face detection**
- Captured frames from webcam using `cv2.VideoCapture`
- Processed frames with grayscale conversion, edge detection, and bounding boxes

### 4. 🧠 Transfer Learning for Image Classification (VGG/ResNet)
- Leveraged pretrained models from `tensorflow.keras.applications` (e.g., ResNet, VGG)
- Fine-tuned model layers for domain-specific classification tasks
- Integrated `callbacks` like EarlyStopping and learning rate schedulers
- Used `decode_predictions` for model interpretability

### 5. 🎯 Real-Time Object Detection with LIME & Explainability
- Trained CNNs for classification and interpreted predictions using `LIME`
- Visualized regions contributing to predictions via `skimage.segmentation.mark_boundaries`
- Explained model outputs on test images using `lime_image`

> ✅ Built entirely from scratch to understand core neural network principles.
